# mysql_music_store
A very simple MySQL base for a music store. Italian language.


I made this file as a little project for a database class in college.
It is still not perfectly working but it can be used to practice with MySQL.

I uploaded a pdf file with all the documentation about the database. It is in italian language. It doesn't describe just the scheme but also the steps to design the database according to the ER model. In the last pages there are some screenshots with examples of successfully completed operations.

Database is the code to create the scheme. Unfortunately it has no notes.

Popolamento DB can be used to populate the db. scriptquery has some example operations code (the ones in the end of the pdf) based on the generic datas from Popolamento DB.
